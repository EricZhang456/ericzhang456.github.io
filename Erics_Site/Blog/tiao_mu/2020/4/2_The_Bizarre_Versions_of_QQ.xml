    <richText>&lt;i&gt;(If you don&#x2019;t know what QQ is, go back to your research)&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;Hi there, Eric here. In this blog post I am going to talk about the versions of QQ that released back in the day. The versions below won&#x2019;t login since they are too old.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://im.qq.com/qq/gainian/"&gt;QQ Concept Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;The QQ Concept Edition is probably the hype train of QQ back then. It even &lt;a href="https://user.qzone.qq.com/1461253251/main"&gt;caught Chairman Hu&#x2019;s attention.&lt;/a&gt; QQ is completely rewritten in WPF. Took full advantage of touch screen computing and WPF. This version added many features such as Desktop Buddy, Avatar Frame and much more. They even made a trailer back then.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The QQ Concept Edition is available for download. However, the system requirement for QQ Concept Edition is too high, at least Windows Vista Service Pack 2 and score 3.5 in Windows Experience Index. QQ Concept Edition is not mouse friendly either, since it takes full advantage of touch screen. Most computers &lt;i&gt;(in China)&lt;/i&gt; back then still has Windows XP installed. The QQ Concept Edition was quickly abandoned and ended at Beta 1.3.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Tencent Messenger&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;There are different versions of Tencent Messenger.</richText>
